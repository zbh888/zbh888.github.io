Hello, I am a computer science researcher, who is currently pursuing a Master of Mathematics degree at the University of Waterloo. My thesis focuses on mitigating signaling storms in 5G cellular networks. Previously, I obtained a Bachelor of Computer Science from the same institution. 

Throughout my studies, I have explored advanced fields such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, 5G cellular networks, and space networks.
I have realized that many modern technological advancements arise from solving important problems with simple and effective ideas. Thus, this is the first principle that I follow while conducting my research. Unfortunately, the problems I solve are not significant enough to be game changers. Perhaps this is why we often say that finding a good problem to solve is 50% of success. Another research principle I adhere to is practicality. I believe an idea in computer science is only useful when it addresses real-world issues. In my related research fields, this mainly involves scalability and use case scenarios.

Over the years, I have found that I enjoy performing data analytics, forecasting, and reasoning. However, I am even more passionate about designing scalable communication systems and communication protocols. The trade-off among security, efficiency, and reliability is very interesting.
